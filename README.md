# Machine Learning from Scratch

This repo aims at recreating machine learning techniques from their bare mathematical forms. I will work and commit finals as time goes. So far have only completed the Dense layer, but will practice with more layer forms. Goal is to compile an entire Neural Network and test it on data for regression and classication models.
